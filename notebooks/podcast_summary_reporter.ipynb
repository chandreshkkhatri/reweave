      "So what makes you of value to the Pied Piper team? Programming, I guess. Pretty good at code, develop algorithms, so forth. Different from the type of algorithm Richard created? Well, yeah. Like, not as good. Richard's a 10 xer. I'm, like, barely an xer. Kind of suck. Yeah, I don't know. Me and Rich have just always kind of, like, been in this together, you know? Together. Right. But to be clear, Richard created the algorithm on his own, yes. Oh, yeah. I had nothing to do with that. He's my best friend. That's true. I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft has a paid best friend. Sergey Brin does. Larry doesn't do shit. See? Hello, again. You know, I don't actually have a ton of dance music, but I turn the bass way up. Baby, you're getting a private show. Hey. What the fuck? Okay, there's the butt time. Someone is paying me. Okay, I didn't come just to dance on your boner all night for free. I was not erect. I. That was. I was only being polite. So you were being polite when you said that you love me? First off, I said you seemed like someone I could fall in love with. And, yes, also politeness. Your ride is here. Oh, hey. Hey. Mushroom stamp? No. Come on, dude, not again. I just wanted to work with computers and get paid for it. I didn't want to end up fighting with my roommates over percentage points. So you're just going to give up? On what? This isn't home. What about Nippler? Mochacino shows her tits for a living, and even she was uncomfortable using it. She said it was sexist. She's right. It's actually per murded. I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing. I'm gonna go get this stuff out of my cube at Hooli and then get in the hell out of this town. So this goodbye, then? I mean, I'll see you back at the house, man. I gotta, like, pack and stuff. Oh, totally. I'm gonna take the train, I think. Just do some thinking. Okay. All right. See you. Train's this way. Oh, I just. I was gonna say. Oh, hey, big hit. You were there. Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank? Oh, not really sure. Richard tried to explain some of this stuff, but a lot of it I didn't really understand, so I'd kind of just nod and smile, you know? Can you at least help us figure out this insane dft spiderweb he's using? Big hit. Whatever shit you're about to dump on my head, you can Save it. Okay? Not in the mood. Dude, I just want to tell you that Gavin Belson wants to talk to you about something. Oh, okay. Fuck you. No, seriously. Gavin Belson said he wants to speak to Nelson Bhaggetti? Yeah, that's what I just said. You will no longer receive any Nucleus related communications, file reports, or attend any Nucleus meetings. Any questions? No, that's pretty clear. Great. Wait, so then, am I being fired? Because I have a three year contract and my stock options don't really exist until after my three. Nobody's being fired, okay? Look, a contract is a contract, you know? You've got a contract and I've got a contract, and we all have contracts. Have I made that perfectly clear? Yeah, no, that's clear. But when I come into work tomorrow, what do I do? That is unclear. Hey. Little help? Oh. Oh, yeah. Hello, Nelson. Thanks for meeting with me. Whoa. Hi. That's cool. Am I a hologram over there, too? What? No, of course not. Question. Do you still talk to Richard Hendricks? Uh, yeah. I. I mean, not about Nucleus or anything. Why would he enter Pied Piper and TechCrunch Disrupt? Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy? Like some. Aw, shucks. Boy genius entering into every man's competition? Mr. Belt? Mr. Nelson, can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, it's just. It's sort of fading. Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm hearing you, it's just the images. Nelson, shut up for a second. If you can hear me, make a gesture. Is it. Do you. I hear you. Is this. I have no idea what you're saying. Nelson. Nelson. Nelson. The audio's still working. You could just use that. The audio is working. Excuse me? I paid 20 million fucking dollars to acquire this company. Fuck you. The audio is working. Audio worked 100 fucking years ago, you fucking piece of shit. Ah, that's better. Sorry. The telehuman is a great piece of technology. Unfortunately, the broadband isn't that great out here in rural Wyoming. That presents a great business opportunity. Make a gesture. Hear me. Oh, for fuck's sake. I think you forgot to update your software. God damn it. Oh. Hello? Oh, hi, Gavin. What's that? I'm. I'm sorry, you're kind of breaking up there. Hello? Hello? What if we took steps to present this individual in a light such that his talents were undeniable? Surely an individual this brilliant would move quickly up the ladder here at Hooley. Surely he'd be promoted rapidly and repeatedly. Someone this brilliant who was there at the inception of Pied Piper, must be Integral to, if not solely responsible for its creation. It's all right. You can come in. Our very own Nelson Bighetti. Otherwise known around here as Baghead. Come on up here, Baghead. What? I'm not sure I understand. You are being promoted. Being named co head Dreamer carries with it a significant pay increase. Greater equity, more favorable investing schedule. See, but I really liked the job I had, you know, I was perfectly happy there. It was kind of the perfect level of involvement for me, I think. And also that other guy, Bannercheck, he did not really seem to like me very much. Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know that he moved four school age children and his elderly mother across the country in order to run Hooley XYZ on his own. So what is my job exactly? Well, that's actually. That's up to you. You can do whatever you want. Okay. See, that's sort of what I do now, though. But starting today, you can do it in a much more significant way. Look at this. Spaghetti has his team wasting valuable resources on a potato cannon. Three, two, one. Jesus. You see what your brightest minds are being wasted on? Launching potatoes. Fuck. Sorry. Well, perhaps they're developing it as a non lethal form of crowd control. One more time. Here we go. Everybody ready? Fire. Oh, shit. You okay? Sorry. Shit. By wearing this standard Huli earbud headphone. Modified with a small piezoelectric sensor. The user can control their huliphone solely with their neural impulses. Seriously? Seriously? This is great. Fuck yes, team. So what's our timeline here? I mean, when can we start testing this? How long before we can integrate this into Nucleus? Not long. It'll probably happen in our lifetime. We just have to figure out how to make it work. We do have the kick ass potato cannon, though. Although actually this one is broken. We tried to put a Mr. Potato Head in it and it did not like that. How are you guys? Everything good over at Nucleus? Nucleus is dog shit. How you doing, man? You used to be the most useless guy in the entire Nucleus team, but now you run an entire division. Did you ever ask yourself why? No. No, I never have. Do you have any skill at all other than magically failing your way to the top? I have a boat. I guess that's not really a skill. I haven't done anything, Richard. I mean, less than nothing. Well, yeah, but look at me now. We are sitting on my boat, Richard. And that's because of you. Soon we can sail up to fucking Hawaii. Or Sausalito. Three more classes and I get My boat license. Oh, really? How many classes does it take? Three. It's three classes. I heard you can pay somebody to take the test for you, but I just haven't got around to it yet. We would like to call Nelson Bighetti, AKA Big Head. Wait, are you sure? Because it says no. Admit. Okay, yeah, you were right. It's this one. Is that me? Haven't you received three Hooli promotions in a month? Yeah. Yeah, I guess that is. Right. You make a meaningful and crucial contribution to everything you do, do you not? Wait, I'm sorry. Do I not? Are you asking if I do do that or if I don't do that? This is amazing. If I don't not do that, isn't that the same as. Let's move on. The most important aspect is the non disclosure, non disparagement clause, in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press, in public, or in private about Hooley or Gavin Belson. Okay, I won't. You will not discuss anything you did at Hooley at all. In perpetuity, throughout the universe. I didn't really do anything at Hooley, so. Good. You're getting the hang of it already. I have to think about this, then. This settlement offer is quite generous. No, I know. I mean, $2 million is a lot of money. Two? No, it's. It's 20 million. 20? Fucking Miami Vice with disgusting architecture. Hey, man. What are you doing here? The fuck are you doing here? What do you mean? This is my house. Crazy, right? This place is huge. Did you wanna. Yes. It would be polite for you to invite me into your home and offer me a push pop. Yes. It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms. You have any idea how scary that gets at night? So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, you know, I felt weird charging them rent. Cause, you know. No, I don't. Well, just like, 20 million, you know, so I don't really need it. But then they felt weird living here without paying me anything, so they offered me pieces of their startups. That's all. You just admitted to starting a competing incubator. I've caught you in a web of your own lies, haven't I? I don't think so. Wait, have you? Jesus. This is a good apple. Where did you get this? Oh, I have a fruit guy. Fantastic. That was weird. I just got a call from Laurie Bream's office at Raviga asking if I'd want an interview for the job of CEO at Pied Piper. What? You Fucking kidding me. That's exactly what I said. Then I said no, and then we both hung up. I mean, I assume they hung up. I had already hung up, so. Wow. Wow. Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. Big head. Big head. Fucking kidding me. The fuck is going on? Ah, the Super Angel Premium Deluxe in the flesh. Yeah, I had to drive to San Mateo to get one that has auto reverse. Why didn't you send your assistant? She was on the phone. So with this token of apology, you've officially righted your wrong. Consider the matter resolved. Cool. Traditionally, the offender shakes the offendee's hand. So you would come to me. That's an honest Thomas. That's what you're gonna call your company? Yeah, well, before it was gonna be Bachman Capital. Cause I provide the Bachmann and he provides the capital. Yeah, but then we compromised and made it Bachmanity. Cause it's Bachmann from him and then the Eddie from me. So it's two syllables each very much into keeping score, this one. So you moved the swimming pool? Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far from the house, like crazy far. So I had this company come and just move it closer. Uh huh. But then you moved it back. Yeah, turns out the guy who built this place knew exactly what he was doing. And the pool was right where it needed to be the whole time. But now I know that for sure, which feels good. You need to manage your expenses and track your receipts a little bit better than this. I'm only as good as the information I have. Oh, you're great. I wasn't fishing for compliments. Hello. Uh, that means hello. Oh, and goodbye. Funneling our money to said other clients. They're in fucking us. I'm sorry to say this is not an uncommon occurrence. Wait, it's not an uncommon. So then it. Okay, got it. You know, he said he wants to be able to keep an eye on me. And. And that I need to get a real job to learn the value of a hard day's night. Or something like that. Well, I should probably get going to this board meeting. And you're probably gonna be gone when I'm back. So I guess this is it. Yeah, I guess so. See ya. Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Oh. All right. Here we go. Cool. Man. If all I accomplish by doing this is making you as miserable as you've made me watching you. If you fleece my son, then I'm okay with that. He seems okay with that. No, no, no, no. Then I would have invested 500, a half of a million dollars just to end up where I started. Unacceptable. I can accept that. I'm going to bed. Good night, Brown Bear. Love you, Papa Bear. Pretty sure my dad would, like, never approve you, but it's just not gonna happen. Thank you. Yeah. There is someone else. Someone who has zero strikes against him. Someone who has held high level positions at one of the biggest tech companies in the Valley. Someone who has been on the COVID of one of the most prestigious tech publications in the world. He sounds awesome. Can we get him? He asked if he could pitch me, and I said sure, and then he kind of just, like, kept talking for a while. Oh, you don't think that could have been the pitch, do you? God damn it. What did he say? Geez, I kind of zoned out. But he did say the word Oculus a whole bunch. Wait, Oculus? Hmm. Oh, my God. It's a VR play. Big Head. Jin Yang's culture, he's Chinese. Won't allow him to accept outside help. Oh, right. Cause of Chinese. Okay, well, that makes sense. Mr. Magetti, when you're ready. Ready for what? I'm, like, the class clown already. Why is my name on the board? Oh, no. Gonna be late for class. Ooh, how's that going? It's okay. I'm just a little nervous I might run out of material soon. We already watched the Facebook movie AI the Net, and half of Tron. Which Tron? What? No Tron. There's two Trons. Oh, shit. Oh, that's awesome. Should get me through another week. Thanks. My colleague here was pretty adamant that a better use of class time might be to learn while accomplishing something. Now, take one, pass it all the way down. We're supposed to scrape the Internet for thousands of food images? Yeah, so you'll find, like, five or 30,000 pictures of your food, and then put them in a folder with that food's name on it. And it's good if you get, like, weird angles or lighting of your food, so it should be pretty fun. Yeah. Come on, man. I need this. All right. I wouldn't ask you otherwise. All right. My username is password, and my password is password. Your username is password? It was just easier. Big hit. Hey, I need you to meet me at the loading dock behind Spilker in 10 minutes. I'll explain there. Now's not really a great time, Richard. I'm sort of in the middle of something. Come on, buddy. I need you. Okay, be right there. Can I go to the bathroom? This is fine. What? Yeah, my bad. I thought you were talking about, like, a lot more stuff. My office is unlocked if you guys just want to, like, toss that on my desk or whatever. I should probably get back, though, before. Before that teacher guy gets me in trouble. I'll see you guys. Is it possible that the general partnership you formed with Ehrlich is still in effect? Oh, no way. You definitely dissolved it? Yeah. My dad insisted. I remember he filled out this whole form for me and made me sign it and mail it in and everything. Yeah. Cause I remember I had the paperwork in one hand and the menu for Mr. Chows in the other, and. And then it. Oh, no way. It's the paperwork. Guess I must have sent the menu. I mean, how would you feel if one of your neighbors got a tiki head bigger than yours? Oh, well, when we bought it, we made sure it was the biggest one they made. So you're the biggest tiki head guy in the neighborhood. What's going on, Richard? There's no easy way to say this. Jin Yang is moving back into the house. Right? Oh, wow. That's a nice touch. Yeah, thanks. The Monterey Bay aquarium was testing their sonar and found this thing, like, two miles under the ocean. And I figure Erlich and I already bought it, so I might as well hold on to it. Plus, it weighs, like, 8,000 pounds, so I couldn't move it if I wanted to. Well, and also, it kind of works as your mascot, right? Because of your name. Oh, yeah. Cause Nelson. Oh, I meant because it's a big head. I guess that works, too.\n",

      "So what makes you of value to the Pied Piper team? Programming, I guess. Pretty good at code, develop algorithms, so forth. Different from the type of algorithm Richard created? Well, yeah. Like, not as good. Richard's a 10 xer. I'm, like, barely an xer. Kind of suck. Yeah, I don't know. Me and Rich have just always kind of, like, been in this together, you know? Together. Right. But to be clear, Richard created the algorithm on his own, yes. Oh, yeah. I had nothing to do with that. He's my best friend. That's true. I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft has a paid best friend. Sergey Brin does. Larry doesn't do shit. See? Hello, again. You know, I don't actually have a ton of dance music, but I turn the bass way up. Baby, you're getting a private show. Hey. What the fuck? Okay, there's the butt time. Someone is paying me. Okay, I didn't come just to dance on your boner all night for free. I was not erect. I. That was. I was only being polite. So you were being polite when you said that you love me? First off, I said you seemed like someone I could fall in love with. And, yes, also politeness. Your ride is here. Oh, hey. Hey. Mushroom stamp? No. Come on, dude, not again. I just wanted to work with computers and get paid for it. I didn't want to end up fighting with my roommates over percentage points. So you're just going to give up? On what? This isn't home. What about Nippler? Mochacino shows her tits for a living, and even she was uncomfortable using it. She said it was sexist. She's right. It's actually per murded. I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing. I'm gonna go get this stuff out of my cube at Hooli and then get in the hell out of this town. So this goodbye, then? I mean, I'll see you back at the house, man. I gotta, like, pack and stuff. Oh, totally. I'm gonna take the train, I think. Just do some thinking. Okay. All right. See you. Train's this way. Oh, I just. I was gonna say. Oh, hey, big hit. You were there. Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank? Oh, not really sure. Richard tried to explain some of this stuff, but a lot of it I didn't really understand, so I'd kind of just nod and smile, you know? Can you at least help us figure out this insane dft spiderweb he's using? Big hit. Whatever shit you're about to dump on my head, you can Save it. Okay? Not in the mood. Dude, I just want to tell you that Gavin Belson wants to talk to you about something. Oh, okay. Fuck you. No, seriously. Gavin Belson said he wants to speak to Nelson Bhaggetti? Yeah, that's what I just said. You will no longer receive any Nucleus related communications, file reports, or attend any Nucleus meetings. Any questions? No, that's pretty clear. Great. Wait, so then, am I being fired? Because I have a three year contract and my stock options don't really exist until after my three. Nobody's being fired, okay? Look, a contract is a contract, you know? You've got a contract and I've got a contract, and we all have contracts. Have I made that perfectly clear? Yeah, no, that's clear. But when I come into work tomorrow, what do I do? That is unclear. Hey. Little help? Oh. Oh, yeah. Hello, Nelson. Thanks for meeting with me. Whoa. Hi. That's cool. Am I a hologram over there, too? What? No, of course not. Question. Do you still talk to Richard Hendricks? Uh, yeah. I. I mean, not about Nucleus or anything. Why would he enter Pied Piper and TechCrunch Disrupt? Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy? Like some. Aw, shucks. Boy genius entering into every man's competition? Mr. Belt? Mr. Nelson, can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, it's just. It's sort of fading. Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm hearing you, it's just the images. Nelson, shut up for a second. If you can hear me, make a gesture. Is it. Do you. I hear you. Is this. I have no idea what you're saying. Nelson. Nelson. Nelson. The audio's still working. You could just use that. The audio is working. Excuse me? I paid 20 million fucking dollars to acquire this company. Fuck you. The audio is working. Audio worked 100 fucking years ago, you fucking piece of shit. Ah, that's better. Sorry. The telehuman is a great piece of technology. Unfortunately, the broadband isn't that great out here in rural Wyoming. That presents a great business opportunity. Make a gesture. Hear me. Oh, for fuck's sake. I think you forgot to update your software. God damn it. Oh. Hello? Oh, hi, Gavin. What's that? I'm. I'm sorry, you're kind of breaking up there. Hello? Hello? What if we took steps to present this individual in a light such that his talents were undeniable? Surely an individual this brilliant would move quickly up the ladder here at Hooley. Surely he'd be promoted rapidly and repeatedly. Someone this brilliant who was there at the inception of Pied Piper, must be Integral to, if not solely responsible for its creation. It's all right. You can come in. Our very own Nelson Bighetti. Otherwise known around here as Baghead. Come on up here, Baghead. What? I'm not sure I understand. You are being promoted. Being named co head Dreamer carries with it a significant pay increase. Greater equity, more favorable investing schedule. See, but I really liked the job I had, you know, I was perfectly happy there. It was kind of the perfect level of involvement for me, I think. And also that other guy, Bannercheck, he did not really seem to like me very much. Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know that he moved four school age children and his elderly mother across the country in order to run Hooley XYZ on his own. So what is my job exactly? Well, that's actually. That's up to you. You can do whatever you want. Okay. See, that's sort of what I do now, though. But starting today, you can do it in a much more significant way. Look at this. Spaghetti has his team wasting valuable resources on a potato cannon. Three, two, one. Jesus. You see what your brightest minds are being wasted on? Launching potatoes. Fuck. Sorry. Well, perhaps they're developing it as a non lethal form of crowd control. One more time. Here we go. Everybody ready? Fire. Oh, shit. You okay? Sorry. Shit. By wearing this standard Huli earbud headphone. Modified with a small piezoelectric sensor. The user can control their huliphone solely with their neural impulses. Seriously? Seriously? This is great. Fuck yes, team. So what's our timeline here? I mean, when can we start testing this? How long before we can integrate this into Nucleus? Not long. It'll probably happen in our lifetime. We just have to figure out how to make it work. We do have the kick ass potato cannon, though. Although actually this one is broken. We tried to put a Mr. Potato Head in it and it did not like that. How are you guys? Everything good over at Nucleus? Nucleus is dog shit. How you doing, man? You used to be the most useless guy in the entire Nucleus team, but now you run an entire division. Did you ever ask yourself why? No. No, I never have. Do you have any skill at all other than magically failing your way to the top? I have a boat. I guess that's not really a skill. I haven't done anything, Richard. I mean, less than nothing. Well, yeah, but look at me now. We are sitting on my boat, Richard. And that's because of you. Soon we can sail up to fucking Hawaii. Or Sausalito. Three more classes and I get My boat license. Oh, really? How many classes does it take? Three. It's three classes. I heard you can pay somebody to take the test for you, but I just haven't got around to it yet. We would like to call Nelson Bighetti, AKA Big Head. Wait, are you sure? Because it says no. Admit. Okay, yeah, you were right. It's this one. Is that me? Haven't you received three Hooli promotions in a month? Yeah. Yeah, I guess that is. Right. You make a meaningful and crucial contribution to everything you do, do you not? Wait, I'm sorry. Do I not? Are you asking if I do do that or if I don't do that? This is amazing. If I don't not do that, isn't that the same as. Let's move on. The most important aspect is the non disclosure, non disparagement clause, in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press, in public, or in private about Hooley or Gavin Belson. Okay, I won't. You will not discuss anything you did at Hooley at all. In perpetuity, throughout the universe. I didn't really do anything at Hooley, so. Good. You're getting the hang of it already. I have to think about this, then. This settlement offer is quite generous. No, I know. I mean, $2 million is a lot of money. Two? No, it's. It's 20 million. 20? Fucking Miami Vice with disgusting architecture. Hey, man. What are you doing here? The fuck are you doing here? What do you mean? This is my house. Crazy, right? This place is huge. Did you wanna. Yes. It would be polite for you to invite me into your home and offer me a push pop. Yes. It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms. You have any idea how scary that gets at night? So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, you know, I felt weird charging them rent. Cause, you know. No, I don't. Well, just like, 20 million, you know, so I don't really need it. But then they felt weird living here without paying me anything, so they offered me pieces of their startups. That's all. You just admitted to starting a competing incubator. I've caught you in a web of your own lies, haven't I? I don't think so. Wait, have you? Jesus. This is a good apple. Where did you get this? Oh, I have a fruit guy. Fantastic. That was weird. I just got a call from Laurie Bream's office at Raviga asking if I'd want an interview for the job of CEO at Pied Piper. What? You Fucking kidding me. That's exactly what I said. Then I said no, and then we both hung up. I mean, I assume they hung up. I had already hung up, so. Wow. Wow. Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. Big head. Big head. Fucking kidding me. The fuck is going on? Ah, the Super Angel Premium Deluxe in the flesh. Yeah, I had to drive to San Mateo to get one that has auto reverse. Why didn't you send your assistant? She was on the phone. So with this token of apology, you've officially righted your wrong. Consider the matter resolved. Cool. Traditionally, the offender shakes the offendee's hand. So you would come to me. That's an honest Thomas. That's what you're gonna call your company? Yeah, well, before it was gonna be Bachman Capital. Cause I provide the Bachmann and he provides the capital. Yeah, but then we compromised and made it Bachmanity. Cause it's Bachmann from him and then the Eddie from me. So it's two syllables each very much into keeping score, this one. So you moved the swimming pool? Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far from the house, like crazy far. So I had this company come and just move it closer. Uh huh. But then you moved it back. Yeah, turns out the guy who built this place knew exactly what he was doing. And the pool was right where it needed to be the whole time. But now I know that for sure, which feels good. You need to manage your expenses and track your receipts a little bit better than this. I'm only as good as the information I have. Oh, you're great. I wasn't fishing for compliments. Hello. Uh, that means hello. Oh, and goodbye. Funneling our money to said other clients. They're in fucking us. I'm sorry to say this is not an uncommon occurrence. Wait, it's not an uncommon. So then it. Okay, got it. You know, he said he wants to be able to keep an eye on me. And. And that I need to get a real job to learn the value of a hard day's night. Or something like that. Well, I should probably get going to this board meeting. And you're probably gonna be gone when I'm back. So I guess this is it. Yeah, I guess so. See ya. Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Oh. All right.

Love you, Papa Bear. Pretty sure my dad would, like, never approve you, but it's just not gonna happen. Thank you. Yeah. There is someone else. Someone who has zero strikes against him. Someone who has held high level positions at one of the biggest tech companies in the Valley. Someone who has been on the COVID of one of the most prestigious tech publications in the world. He sounds awesome. Can we get him? He asked if he could pitch me, and I said sure, and then he kind of just, like, kept talking for a while. Oh, you don't think that could have been the pitch, do you? God damn it. What did he say? Geez, I kind of zoned out. But he did say the word Oculus a whole bunch. Wait, Oculus? Hmm. Oh, my God. It's a VR play. Big Head. Jin Yang's culture, he's Chinese. Won't allow him to accept outside help. Oh, right. Cause of Chinese. Okay, well, that makes sense. Mr. Magetti, when you're ready. Ready for what? I'm, like, the class clown already. Why is my name on the board? Oh, no. Gonna be late for class. Ooh, how's that going? It's okay. I'm just a little nervous I might run out of material soon. We already watched the Facebook movie AI the Net, and half of Tron. Which Tron? What? No Tron. There's two Trons. Oh, shit. Oh, that's awesome. Should get me through another week. Thanks. My colleague here was pretty adamant that a better use of class time might be to learn while accomplishing something.

I should probably get back, though, before. Before that teacher guy gets me in trouble. I'll see you guys. Is it possible that the general partnership you formed with Ehrlich is still in effect? Oh, no way. You definitely dissolved it? Yeah. My dad insisted. I remember he filled out this whole form for me and made me sign it and mail it in and everything. Yeah.
