    "\n",
    "### How to use this updated chess commentary generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Usage**: \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Just paste your PGN and get commentary!\n",
    "   your_pgn = \"[Event...] 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3...\"\n",
    "   commentary = generate_chess_commentary(your_pgn)\n",
    "   print(commentary)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Use the RealCommentaryGenerator class directly for more control\n",
    "   generator = RealCommentaryGenerator()\n",
    "   result = generator.analyze_game_for_commentary(your_pgn)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's different in this version:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real Commentary Patterns** - Based on actual Chess Network and Hikaru transcripts  \n",
    "✅ **Authentic Language** - Uses actual phrases and expressions from both creators  \n",
    "✅ **Structured Output** - Generates opening, middlegame, endgame, and summary sections  \n",
    "✅ **Easy Integration** - Simple function call generates complete commentary  \n",
    "✅ **Mixed Styles** - Seamlessly blends Jerry's educational approach with Hikaru's entertainment  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chess Network Style**: \"Hi everyone, it's Jerry\", detailed analysis, computer evaluations\n",
    "- **Hikaru Style**: \"Chat, this is just winning\", quick assessments, casual observations  \n",
    "- **Game Phase Analysis**: Different commentary styles for opening, middlegame, endgame\n",
    "- **Realistic Flow**: Natural transitions between analytical and entertaining commentary"

      "🎙️ OPENING COMMENTARY:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi everyone, it's Jerry. I have an excellent game to share with you from London. This is a 1851.06.21 game between Anderssen, Adolf playing white against Kieseritzky, Lionel. We're looking at 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Bc4 Qh4+. This demonstrates classical opening principles with both sides developing their pieces harmoniously. Now, going into this position, both players are following standard theory, but Anderssen, Adolf could have also considered other setups. Chat, this is pretty normal opening play. Like, both sides are just developing and fighting for the center. \n",
      "\n",
      "⚔️ MIDDLEGAME COMMENTARY:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Now let's examine this position carefully. Anderssen, Adolf has just played 7.d3, and this creates several interesting possibilities. The key question here is how Anderssen, Adolf should continue. If we look at the pawn structure, we can see that Anderssen, Adolf has good piece coordination and central control. Chat, this position is actually pretty interesting. Like, Anderssen, Adolf has some ideas here, but the opponent definitely has counterplay. I mean, it's not completely winning, but there are chances. The computer evaluation here shows this is approximately equal, but in a practical game, the player with better time management and tactical vision will likely prevail. \n",
      "\n",
      "🏁 ENDGAME COMMENTARY:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "In this endgame position, we can see the importance of precise technique. The final moves 22.Qf6+ Nxf6 23.Be7# demonstrate excellent endgame understanding. This is exactly how you want to convert a winning position - methodically and accurately. And that's the game! White gets the win with some really nice play. Chat, this was actually a pretty instructive game. Like, both players showed good opening preparation, but ultimately White was just more accurate in the critical moments. \n",
      "\n",
      "📝 GAME SUMMARY:\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "This was an excellent 23-move game between Anderssen, Adolf and Kieseritzky, Lionel from London. Anderssen, Adolf wins. Both players demonstrated solid opening preparation and tactical awareness. As always, feel free to leave any feedback in the comments section below. Hope you enjoyed it and maybe took a thing or two away. That's all for now. Take care!\n",
